Implement MSE, NEES or NIS.
MSE: ok, calculate total after the run
NEES and NIS is done each step. Need some kind of covariance matrices P and S? Can I use the mhe weight matrices? Not meaningful unless weight matrices accurately depict statistical uncertainty (covariance). In my case they're tuned heuristically for performance.
Hedengreen (2006): Used normalized variance of model errors:	Var(y_measured - y_predicted) / Var(y_measured). Implement after run and do in total for alll data points

Report:

Theory: getting there + MSE/NEES/NIS
Literature study: I dont know, should I do this? Isnt this kinda like theory part?
Method:
	Connecting and tuning the 3.0 maglev, different tests and their performance, how to evaluate performance, thought process behind 	tuning, centering bias, response etc.
	MHE: info about the data set and problem and model, implementing MHE (do-mpc), review code, computation time/not use whole 	dataset. What comparisons will be made, what parameters will be tuned, how to compare (MSE, NEES, NIS)? [What to expect? 	(Should this be in methods?)]
Results
	Show results from comparisons
	
Disussion
	Discuss results compared to our hypothesis, what went wrong, what can be done better, what assumptions or shortcuts were taken
	What can be further developed
Conclusion


mean absolute error mae + distribution of errors histogram of errorz

3.0 is now being replaced by 4.0

look at other portion of data set (last 10% ?)
